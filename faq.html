      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why study music and health?</h3>
        <p>Music has been an integral part of human culture for thousands of years, and emerging research suggests it may have profound effects on our physical and mental well-being. By studying the connection between music and health, we can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Understand therapeutic potential:</strong> Music therapy is already used in clinical settings to help with anxiety, depression, and pain management</li>
          <li><strong>Explore physiological responses:</strong> Music can influence heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones, and brain activity</li>
          <li><strong>Develop personalized approaches:</strong> Different people respond differently to various musical elements, and understanding these patterns could lead to personalized wellness strategies</li>
          <li><strong>Bridge art and science:</strong> This research combines the emotional power of music with rigorous scientific methodology</li>
          <li><strong>Advance knowledge:</strong> Every study contributes to our understanding of how sound affects the human body and mind</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this medical advice?</h3>
        <p><strong>No, this research is not medical advice.</strong> This study is purely educational and research-focused. Here's what you should know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Educational purpose only:</strong> This research is designed to explore the relationship between music and physiological responses for academic and scientific understanding</li>
          <li><strong>Not a treatment:</strong> The music selections and measurements are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical condition</li>
          <li><strong>Consult healthcare professionals:</strong> If you have any health concerns, please consult with qualified medical professionals</li>
          <li><strong>Research data:</strong> Any data collected is for research purposes and should not be used to make medical decisions</li>
          <li><strong>Individual differences:</strong> Everyone responds differently to music, and what works for one person may not work for another</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why measure blood pressure?</h3>
        <p>Blood pressure is one of the most important vital signs that can be influenced by music and emotional states. Here's why it's valuable to measure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stress indicator:</strong> Blood pressure can rise in response to stress, anxiety, or excitement, and certain types of music may help regulate these responses</li>
          <li><strong>Relaxation marker:</strong> Calming music has been shown to potentially lower blood pressure, making it a useful measure of relaxation effectiveness</li>
          <li><strong>Physiological baseline:</strong> By measuring before and after music exposure, we can see if there are measurable changes in cardiovascular response</li>
          <li><strong>Research validity:</strong> Blood pressure provides objective, quantifiable data that complements subjective emotional ratings</li>
          <li><strong>Safety monitoring:</strong> While this is educational research, monitoring blood pressure helps ensure participant safety during the study</li>
          <li><strong>Scientific rigor:</strong> Objective measurements like blood pressure add credibility and scientific value to the research findings</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the ethical considerations?</h3>
